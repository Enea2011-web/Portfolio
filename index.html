                    Hi, I'm a self-taught web developer with 1 year of hands-on experience building modern, responsive websites and web applications. I specialize in front-end development, with a strong focus on clean code, user experience, and continuous learning.
Over the past year, I’ve worked on personal projects that have helped me develop skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm passionate about turning ideas into functional, user-friendly digital experiences and always looking for ways to improve and grow as a developer.
